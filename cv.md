### Code example:
Codewars:  Help the frog to find a way to freedom
>You have an array of integers and have a frog at the first position
`[Frog, int, int, int, ..., int]`
The integer itself may tell you the length and the direction of the jump
Your objective is to find how many jumps are needed to jump out of the array.
Return  `-1`  if Frog can't jump out of the array.

```
function solution(a) {
    let steps = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < a.length+1; i++) {
        if (steps < 0 || steps >= a.length) {
            return i;
        } else {
            steps += a[steps];   
        } 
    }
    return -1;
  }
